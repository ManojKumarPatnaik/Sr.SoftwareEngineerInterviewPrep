# Machine learning
**[Machine learning](https://ai.stanford.edu/people/nilsson/MLBOOK.pdf)** (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of **artificial intelligence**. 
Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data",
in order to make **predictions** or **decisions** without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of
applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
