# DAY-2
### 1st Question

**Objective**
- In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for a breakdown of probability fundamentals!


**Task**
- In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.


- [ ] 2 / 3
- [X] 5 / 6
- [ ] 1 / 4
- [ ] 1 / 6

### 2nd Question
**Objective**
- In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. We recommend you review the previous challenge's Tutorial before attempting this problem.


**Task**
- In a single toss 2 of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.


- [X] 1 / 9
- [ ] 1 / 6
- [ ] 2 / 3
- [ ] 5 / 6

### 3rd Question
**Objective**
- In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge.

**Task**
- There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

* Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
* Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
* Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

- [ ] 10 / 63
- [ ] 2 / 7
- [X] 17 / 42
- [ ] 31 / 126
