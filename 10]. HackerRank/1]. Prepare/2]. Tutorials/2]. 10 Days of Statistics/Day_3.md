### 1st Question
**Objective**
- In this challenge, we get started with conditional probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

**Task**
- Suppose a family has  children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

- [X] 1 / 3
- [ ] 1 / 2
- [ ] 2 / 3
- [ ] 1 / 9

- In this challenge, we're getting started with combinations and permutations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

**Task**
- You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

- [ ] 1 / 156

### 3rd Question
**Objective**
- In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.


**Task**
- A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

- [ ] 1 / 12
- [ ] 7 / 12
- [ ] 1 / 6
- [X] 2 / 3
