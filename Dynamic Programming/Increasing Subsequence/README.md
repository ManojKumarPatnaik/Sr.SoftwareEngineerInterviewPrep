LIS is a standard problem from dp. But look at the constraint. It expected a solution of at max nlogn. Check this [blog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-monotonically-increasing-subsequence-size-n-log-n/) out it contains most detailed way to contruct nlogn solution plus it contains my python and java code.
