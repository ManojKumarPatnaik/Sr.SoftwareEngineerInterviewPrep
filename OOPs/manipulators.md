### Manipulators
Manipulators, which are also known as setters or mutators, are a way of controlling how users of your code may properly modify private data fields.
Manipulators are usually methods in the class with the private data field with their own implementations -- the implementation can be as simple as `privateField = inputField`, or the code for setting can involve a multitude of checks and processing.
As you can see, manipulators give a lot of room for developers to control how they want their classes to function.

### Naming Conventions
As per [JavaBeans](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javabeans-spec.html) naming conventions, manipulators (or setters) should be named as `set<Datafield>(param args)`, where `<Datafield>` is the datafield you want to modify.

### Example
```java
// A very barebones java class demonstrating manipulators

public class Userinfo() {
    private String username;
    private String password; // This is just an example, don't actually do this due to security reasons
    private int userNumber;
    private static numOfUsers = 0;
    
    public Userinfo() {
        userNumber = numOfUsers++; // Assign user number before incrementing
        username = "user-" + userNumber;
        password = "";
    }
    
    public Userinfo(String username, String password) {
        userNumber = numOfUsers++; // Assign user number before incrementing
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }
        
    // Set new username with password, returns success state
    public void setUsername(String newUsername, String confirmPassword) {
        if (checkPassword(confirmPassword) {
            username = newUsername;
            return true;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }
        
    // Set new password with password, returns success state
    public boolean setPassword(String newPassword, String confirmPassword) {
        if (checkPassword(confirmPassword)) {
            password = newPassword;
            return true;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // Check password
    private boolean checkPassword(String attemptPassword) {
        return attemptPassword.equals(password);
    }
}
```
The example above is a class for storing userdata. At the moment, there are only two pieces of data that are stored - a username and a password. They are set to type `private`, which is a good practice of OOP. In order to change the variables, you must use maniuplators (`setUsername()` & `setPassword()`) which implements a password check before changing.
