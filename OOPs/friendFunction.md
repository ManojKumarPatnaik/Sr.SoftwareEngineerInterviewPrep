## Friend Function

### Introduction
In object-oriented programming, a friend function, that is a "friend" of a given class, is a function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data. And, friend functions do not *"violate encapsulation"*.

### Friend Function in Java
Java does not have the friend keyword from C++. There is, however, a way to emulate that; a way that actually gives a lot more precise control. Suppose that you have classes `A` and `B`. and `A.foo()` should only be called by `B`. This can be arranged by a token that can only be generated by `B`.
```java
public class B
{
    public static class ToA { private ToA(){} }
    private static final ToA b2a = new ToA();

    void test()
    {
        new A().foo(b2a);
    }
}

public class A
{
    public void foo(B.ToA b2a)
    {
        if(b2a==null)
            throw new Error("you ain't B");
        // ...
    }
}

```

Only `B` can generate a non-null `B.ToA` token. If both `A` and `B` do not leak this token to the 3rd party, nobody else can invoke `A.foo()`
