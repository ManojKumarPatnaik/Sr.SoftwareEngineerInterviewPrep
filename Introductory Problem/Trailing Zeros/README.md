[problem](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1618/)

This is a aptitude problem under numbers.

basically the number of zeros in any number depends upon number of 5 and 2 in it's factors. 

since this is a factorial number, numbers of 5 will be less than number of 2. hence we only need to count how many 5 as a factor exist in n!

time - log(n) to base 5
